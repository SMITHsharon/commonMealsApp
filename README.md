# Common Meals App

### Project Description 

My capstone front-end project, this is an app designed for the residents of Germantown Commons to facailitate the scheduling of common meals. Users (residents) can schedule a meal, be assigned to a cook team when scheduling a meal, and sign-up to attend a meal.
